// Package graph provides operations over the relations total graph
//
// Relation tuples represent a relation graph between objects.
// Due to userset rewerite rules however, the tuples only define a subgraph over the relations.
// Rewrite Rules add nodes and edges to the relation graph, which must be accounted for while performing searches.
